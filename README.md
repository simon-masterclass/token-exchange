# Token Exchange [Demo App]

This is a fully functional decentralized token exchange deployed to 2 test networks - Ethereum's Goerli test network and Polygon's Mumbai test-net.

To interact with this Decentralized application (Dapp), you will need a MetaMask wallet. 
If you're interesed in giving this Dapp a test drive, you will need some test-net currency (for transaction fees), mETH ("mock ETHer") and mDAI ("mock DAI").

Please reach out to Simon Ionashku at simon.ionashku@gmail.com with the follow information:

1) Your Name
2) Your Organization
3) Your public MetaMask account address (not your private key)

Simon will run a custom script that will deposit Goerli Test Ether (or test MATIC for Polygon Mumbai), mETH and mDAI directly into your wallet.

That's it, thanks!
